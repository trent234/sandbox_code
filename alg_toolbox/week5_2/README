This program solves the "knapsack problem" with dynamic programming:

Task:
In this problem, you are given a set of bars of gold and your goal is to take as much gold as possible
into your bag. There is just one copy of each bar and for each bar you can either take it or not (hence
you cannot take a fraction of a bar).

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains the capacity W of a knapsack and the number n of bars
of gold. The next line contains n integers w 0 , w 1 , . . . , w n−1 defining the weights of the bars of gold.

Constraints:
 1 ≤ W ≤ 10 4 ; 1 ≤ n ≤ 300; 0 ≤ w 0 , . . . , w n−1 ≤ 10 5 .
